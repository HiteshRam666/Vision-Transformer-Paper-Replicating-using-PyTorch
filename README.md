## **What is paper replicating?**

It's no secret machine learning is advancing fast.

Many of these advances get published in machine learning research papers.

And the goal of paper replicating is to replicate these advances with code so you can use the techniques for your own problem.

For example, let's say a new model architecture gets released that performs better than any other architecture before on various benchmarks, wouldn't it be nice to try that architecture on your own problems?

Machine learning paper replicating involves turning a machine learning paper comprised of images/diagrams, math and text into usable code and in our case, usable PyTorch code. Diagram, math equations and text from the ViT paper.


## **Why replicate a machine learning research paper?**

A machine learning research paper is often a presentation of months of work and experiments done by some of the best machine learning teams in the world condensed into a few pages of text.

And if these experiments lead to better results in an area related to the problem you're working on, it'd be nice to check them out.

Also, replicating the work of others is a fantastic way to practice your skills.

## What is Vision Transformer ?

Vision Transformer (ViT) emerged as a competitive alternative to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that are currently state-of-the-art in computer vision and widely used for different image recognition tasks. ViT models outperform the current state-of-the-art CNNs by almost four times in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy.

Although convolutional neural networks have dominated the field of computer vision for years, new vision transformer models have also shown remarkable abilities, achieving comparable and even better performance than CNNs on many computer vision tasks.
